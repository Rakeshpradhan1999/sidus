            THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF SIDUS

            SIDUS: NFT Heroes is an Original collection of 6,000 unique,
            generative characters. The collection features 4500 Original NFT
            Heroes including Partnership Heroes, 1,000 Rare Heroes, 500
            Legendary Heroes. Only the Original Heroes can be purchased. The
            remaining characters must be created by applying special upgrade
            cards and the Galaxy Modificator to the Original Heroes.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to lore, the Heroes all came to the independent city of
            SIDUS from one of 12 blockchain planetary systems (Bitcoione,
            Avalanya, Polygopus, Tronguan, etc.) while seeking refuge from the
            intergalactic war. Each Heroâ€™s home planet has left an imprint on
            their appearance, character and armor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The utility of NFT Heroes from the Founders collection varies from
            being an NFT avatar and gaming character, to being a tool for
            accumulating liquidity (using the NFT wrapping feature), the NFT
            yield farming service.
